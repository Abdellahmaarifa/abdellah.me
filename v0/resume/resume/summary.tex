As a software developer, I started the infinite loop of learning, coding, and
debugging two years ago, and during this period I've completed many projects
that meet together to build the foundational of programming, that is what the
common core in 1337 is all about, by the time i adopt my own mental model for
programming, and i am looking to apply my knowledge into scalable solutions
in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
